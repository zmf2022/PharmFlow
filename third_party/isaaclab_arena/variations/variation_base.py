"""Variation abstract base classes.

A :class:`VariationBase` pairs a target asset with a sampler and a hook that
realises one tweak to the scene. Variations attach to any
:class:`~isaaclab_arena.assets.asset.Asset` and start disabled. Concrete
variations subclass one of two flavors:

* :class:`RunTimeVariationBase` — realised via an event term during simulation
  (e.g. per-reset randomization).
* :class:`BuildTimeVariationBase` — sampled once and applied to asset configs
  before the env cfg is composed (e.g. picking a dome-light HDR).
