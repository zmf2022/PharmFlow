    Picks the sbi estimator from the schema:

    - MNPE when any factor is categorical (it handles mixed continuous + categorical theta).
    - NPE when every factor is continuous.

    Following sbi's convention, ``theta`` is the per-episode factor values (the inputs the
    posterior is inferred over) and ``x`` is the per-episode outcomes (the observations a query
    conditions on). It trains on the full (theta, x) and samples the joint posterior at a chosen
    observation. The single observation conditions on *all* outcome columns at once, so a
    query like "which factors produced success?" is answered for every factor jointly.

    Continuous factors are normalized to [0, 1] before fitting and denormalized when
    sampling, so factors on very different scales (e.g. light in thousands, an offset in
    hundredths) train on equal footing. Categorical columns keep their integer codes.
