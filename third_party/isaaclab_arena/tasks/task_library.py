# Importing these concrete task modules fires their @register_task decorators. This must
# NOT live in tasks/__init__.py: that runs on any `from isaaclab_arena.tasks.X import Y`,
# including at pytest-collection time, and the cascade pulls in pxr/USD modules before
# SimulationApp() is created — which segfaults the sim. Instead it is imported lazily by
# ensure_assets_registered() (called after the sim app is up), mirroring object_library.
